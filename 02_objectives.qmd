## Definition of the Objectives

The development of the rFishStatus R package is driven by the need to address critical challenges in managing and utilizing fish occurrence data. The primary objectives of this artifact are:

1. To improve data curation and accuracy:
    * Provide tools to process reference data.
    * Facilitate the updating of species status and nomenclature in existing occurrence datasets.
2. To streamline taxonomic harmonization:
    * Offer functions to address the taxonomic harmonization by matching species names from input lists or occurrence datasets against a reference database and verifying their current status.
    * Combine existing tools and knowledge into a unified solution that facilitates a streamlined workflow for harmonizing taxonomic information.
3. To support data validation and error reduction by end-users:
    * Develop functionalities that flag incorrect or outdated species status, and also propose possible corrections.
    * Enable users to interpret and compare species input data effectively.
    * Provide tools that can be customized by end-users to align with their specific requirements.
