	abstract = {The paper motivates, presents, demonstrates in use, and evaluates a methodology for conducting design science ({DS}) research in information systems ({IS}). {DS} is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several researchers have pioneered {DS} research in {IS}, yet over the past 15 years, little {DS} research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for {DS} research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology ({DSRM}) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing {DS} research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating {DS} research in {IS}. The {DS} process includes six steps: problem identiﬁcation and motivation, deﬁnition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the {DSRM}, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an {IS} planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisﬁes the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of {DS} research in the {IS} discipline.},

A theoretical and conceptual methodological approach based on an extensive literature review was used. The literature review showed that the concepts of the methodology proposed associated to Design Science Research ({DSR}) are relevant and can be applied to Production Engineering. The present study presents a review of {DS} and {DSR} concepts stressing the importance of defining the classes of problems and the artifacts to solve them. It also suggests appropriate steps to conduct {DSR} in Production Engineering context. To deepen the understanding of the meaning of {DSR}, this article also makes analyses and comparisons between {DSR}, Case Study, and Action Research in order to clarify the main differences between these methods. Finally, this study makes some remarks on the application of {DSR} methods and the validation of {DSR} results.},

	abstract = {Our knowledge of biodiversity hinges on suﬃcient data, reliable methods, and realistic models. Without an accurate assessment of species distributions, we cannot eﬀectively target and stem biodiversity loss. Species range maps are the foundation of such eﬀorts, but countless studies have failed to account for the most basic assumptions of reliable species mapping practices, undermining the credibility of their results and potentially misleading and hindering conservation and management eﬀorts. Here, we use examples from the recent literature and broader conservation community to highlight the substantial shortfalls in current practices and their consequences for both analyses and conservation management. We detail how diﬀerent decisions on data ﬁltering impact the outcomes of analysis and provide practical recommendations and steps for more reliable analysis, whilst understanding the limits of what available data will reliably allow and what methods are most appropriate. Whilst “perfect” analyses are not possible for many taxa given limited data, and biases, ensuring we use data within reasonable limits and understanding inherent assumptions is crucial to ensure appropriate use. By embracing and enacting such best practices, we can ensure both the accuracy and improved comparability of biodiversity analyses going forward, ultimately enhancing our ability to use data to facilitate our protection of the natural world.},

	abstract = {Interpretations and analytical practices surrounding {DNA} barcoding are examined using a compilation of 3,756 papers (as of December 31, 2018) with “{DNA} Barcode” in the abstract published since 2004. By examining the rise of {DNA} barcoding in natural history and biodiversity science over this period, we hope to detect the extent to which its purposes, premises, rationale and application have evolved. The number of studies involving identiﬁcation, taxonomic decisions and the discovery of cryptic species has grown rapidly and appears to have driven much of the publication activity of {DNA} barcode studies overall. Forensic studies and papers on biological conservation involving {DNA} barcodes have loosely tracked the ensemble number of studies but appear to have risen sharply in 2017. Although analytical paradigms have diversiﬁed, particularly following the growing availability of tools in {BoLD}, neighbor-joining and graphic (tree-based) criteria for species delimitation remain preeminent. We conclude that the practices and paradigms of {DNA} barcoding data are likely to persist and, in groups such as Lepidoptera, remain a widely used tool in taxonomic science.},

                  The process of standardizing taxon names, taxonomic name harmonization, is necessary to properly merge data indexed by taxon names. The large variety of taxonomic databases and related tools are often not well described. It is often unclear which databases are actively maintained or what is the original source of taxonomic information. In addition, software to access these databases is developed following non‐compatible standards, which creates additional challenges for users. As a result, taxonomic harmonization has become a major obstacle in ecological studies that seek to combine multiple datasets.
                
                
                  
                    Here, we review and categorize a set of major taxonomic databases publicly available as well as a large collection of R packages to access them and to harmonize lists of taxon names. We categorized available taxonomic databases according to their taxonomic breadth (e.g. taxon specific vs. multi‐taxa) and spatial scope (e.g. regional vs. global), highlighting strengths and caveats of each type of database. We divided R packages according to their function, (e.g. syntax standardization tools, access to online databases, etc.) and highlighted overlaps among them. We present our findings (e.g. network of linkages, data and tool characteristics) in a ready‐to‐use Shiny web application (available at:
                    https://mgrenie.shinyapps.io/taxharmonizexplorer/
                    ).
                  
                
                
                  We also provide general guidelines and best practice principles for taxonomic name harmonization. As an illustrative example, we harmonized taxon names of one of the largest databases of community time series currently available. We showed how different workflows can be used for different goals, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses and providing practical solutions to avoid common pitfalls.
                
                
                  To our knowledge, our opinionated review represents the most exhaustive evaluation of links among and of taxonomic databases and related R tools. Finally, based on our new insights in the field, we make recommendations for users, database managers and package developers alike.},
